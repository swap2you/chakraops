# Custom markers for test hygiene (see docs/tests/SKIPPED_TESTS.md)
markers =
    external: tests that require external services or are non-deterministic (excluded by default in CI)
    legacy: tests for superseded or unused code; kept for reference (excluded by default)
    integration: tests that require optional dependencies (e.g. FastAPI) or app server
